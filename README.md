Pattern-Based-Line-Aggregator
=============================

Pattern Based Line Aggregator simply parses an input file, matching each text line against the user specified pattern. If the result is true and the aggregator option was chosen then that line is written to the new text file. If the result is true and the removal option was chosen then that line is removed from the resulting file. Created by Craig Lotter, April 2006
